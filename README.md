# CleanMovie 

A demo movie android app that demonstrates Clean Architecture and is written in Kotlin
Best practice built entirely with Jetpack Compose and cutting-edge libraries like
Coroutines, Flow, Hilt, etc.

# Clean Architecture

The core principles of the clean approach can be summarized as followed:

#### 1. The application code is separated into layers.

These layers define the separation of concerns inside the code base.

#### 2. The layers follow a strict dependency rule.

Each layer can only interact with the layers below it.

#### 3. As we move toward the bottom layer â€” the code becomes generic.

The bottom layers dictate policies and rules, and the upper layers dictate implementation details such as the database, networking manager, and UI.

## Built With ðŸ› 
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - A live data replacement.

- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [Paging3](https://kotlinlang.org/) - Load and display small chunks of data at a time.
    - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - [SavedStateHandle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/lifecycle/SavedStateHandle) - A handle to saved state passed down to androidx.lifecycle.ViewModel.
    - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
    - [Navigation Components](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started) - Navigate fragments easier.
    - [Room](https://developer.android.google.cn/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - Persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
    - [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) - Schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks

- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection)
    - [Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt) - Easier way to incorporate Dagger DI into Android application.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
- [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) - For Mocking and Unit Testing


### TODO

- Add Offline first support
- Unit Tests
